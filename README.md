# django-keeper

Authorization library for Django, not depends on models.

* Won't depend on models
* Won't depend on datastores
* Won't depend on Django's permission system
* Won't depend on Django's User model

Supported versions:

* Python3.8
* Python 3.9
* Django 2.2
* Django 3.0
* Django 3.1
* Django 3.2
* Django 4.1
* Django 4.2

## Install

```bash
$ pip install django-keeper
```

And add to INSTALLED_APPS

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'keeper',
]
```

## At A Glance

Declarative permission mapping for models.

```python
from django.conf import settings
from keeper.security import Allow
from keeper.operators import Everyone, Authenticated, IsUser


class Issue(models.Model):
    author = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)
    ...

    def __acl__(self):
        return [
            (Allow, Everyone, 'view'),
            (Allow, Authenticated, 'add_comment'),
            (Allow, IsUser(self.author), 'edit'),
        ]

```

Instances of model allow:

* Every requests to view
* Autheticated requests to add comments
* it's author to edit

Then, apply `@keeper` for views.

```python
from keeper.views import keeper


# Model Permissions
@keeper(
    'view',
    model=Issue,
    mapper=lambda request, issue_id: {'id': issue_id},
)
def issue_detail(request, issue_id):
    """ View requires 'view' permission of Issue model

    * An issue object will be retrieved
    * keeper will check whether the rquests has 'view' permission for the issue

    The third argument function can return keyword argument to retrieve the issue object.
    """
    request.k_context  # Will be instance of the issue object
    ...



@keeper(
    'add_comment',
    model=Issue,
    mapper=lambda request, issue_id: {'id': issue_id},
)
def add_comment(request, issue_id):
    ...

```

## Global Permission

Not just for model permissions `django-keeper` can handle global permissions.

First, write class having `__acl__` method in models.py.

```python
class Root:
    def __acl__(self):
        return [
            (Allow, Authenticated, 'view_dashboard'),
            (Allow, Authenticated, 'add_issue'),
        ]
```

It's not necessary to put it in `models.py`,
but easy to understand.

And specify it in settings.

```python
KEEPER_GLOBAL_CONTEXT = 'myapp.models.Root'
```

Then you can use global permission in views.
Simply just apply `@keeper` and permission names.

```python
@keeper('add_issue')
def issue_list(request):
    """ View requires 'add_issue' permission of Root Context
    """

```

## Operators

Operators is just `Callable[[HttpRequest], bool]`.
By default django-keeper has these operators:

* `keeper.operators.Everyone`
* `keeper.operators.Authenticated`
* `keeper.operators.IsUser`
* `keeper.operators.Staff`

Also you can create your own operators easily.

```python
from keeper.operators import Authenticated, Operator


class IsIP(Operator):
    def __init__(self, ip):
        self.ip = ip
        
    def __call__(self, request):
        return request.META.get('REMOTE_ADDR') == self.ip


class BelongsTeam(Authenticated):
    def __init__(self, team, role):
        self.team = team

    def __call__(self, request):
        if not super().__call__(request):
            return False
        return  request.user.team == self.team
```

Use it in ACL

```python
class Article(models.Model):
    team = models.ForeignKey(Team)
    
    def __acl__(self):
        return [
            (Allow, Everyone, 'view'),
            (Allow, BelongsTeam(self.team), 'edit'),
            (Allow, IsIP(settings.COMPANY_IP_ADDRESS), 'edit'),
        ]
```

### Combining operators

You can use bitwise operators to combine multiple "Operators".


```python
class Article(models.Model):
    def __acl__(self):
        return [
            (Allow, Authenticated() & IsIP(settings.COMPANY_IP_ADDRESS), 'view'),
        ]
```

There operators can be used

* `a & b`
* `a | b`
* `a ^ b`
* `~a`

## On Fail Actions

You can change actions when requests can't pass ACLs.

```python
from keeper.views import keeper, login_required

@keeper(
    'view_articles',
    on_fail=login_required(),
)
def dashboard(request):
    ...
```

This view will behave just like `@login_required` decorator of Django
when requests don't have 'view' permission.

Also you can use other actions.

* `keeper.views.login_required`
* `keeper.views.permission_denied`
* `keeper.views.not_found`
* `keeper.views.redirect`

## Use in template

Handling permissions in templates is also supported.

```django
{% load keeper %}

{% has_permission issue 'edit' as can_edit %}

{% if can_edit %}
    <a href="...">Edit</a>
{% endif %}
```

When checking global permission, use `has_global_permission`.

```django
{% load keeper %}

{% has_global_permission 'add_issue' as can_add_issue %}

{% if can_add_issue %}
    <a href="...">New Issue</a>
{% endif %}
```

## With Django Core

Add the authentication backend:

```python
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
    'keeper.permissions.ObjectPermissionBackend',
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
)
```

Now `User.has_perm` method will consider permissions of django-keeper.

## Alternative

* [django-guardian](https://github.com/django-guardian/django-guardian)
    * It depends on databases
    * Not way to handle global permissions, not just for a model
* [django-rules](https://github.com/dfunckt/django-rules)
    * Basiaclly, rules is used with Django's permissions, but keeper isn't (basiacally).
    * rules doesn't support view decorators or mixins for it's "rules" system (for Django's permission, yes).
## FAQ

* Can I filter models by using ACL?
    * Not supported
